I am a PhD student at the C.N Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University in New York. I am primarily interested in the intersection of cosmology and particle physics. Currently I am working on phenomenological models of non-smooth dark energy. I am also (slowly) working on cosmological perturbation theory within some of these models, as well as ones with a well defined Lagrangian.

In the past, I have worked on machine learning cosmological emulators (masters degree) and taggers in the ATLAS detector (undergraduate degree).
